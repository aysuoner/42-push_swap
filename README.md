# push_swap

## What is the push_swap?

In this project i created 2 stack and 11 moves methods for sorting algorithm.
This project wants to us to sort entered random numbers from smallest to largerst with fewest moves.
It allows us to use only 2 stacks to do this.

**Push_Swap** must conform to the [42 Norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf). <br />
Using normal ```libc``` functions is strictly forbidden. Students are however, allowed to use: ```write```, ```read```, ```malloc```, ```free```, ```exit```. 
It must not have any memory leaks. Errors must be handled carefully. <br />
In no way can it quit in an unexpected manner (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc).

## What does push_swap teach us?
difference between stack and heap,
sorting algorithm,
sorting algorithm types like radix sort, Bubble sort, quick sort...
